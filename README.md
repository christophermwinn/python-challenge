# python-challenge
Module 3- UTA Data Bootcamp

This challenge consisted of two parts.
PyBank involved an financial analysis of a company.  
Code was written to determine the profits and losses,
the changes over time, and the months with the biggest
profits and losses.  These results were written to the screen
and were also saved in a text file.  The text file is
in the Analysis folder.

PyPoll involved election data.  Each line of the data
was a vote for a particular candidate.  Code was written
to calculate the number of votes for each candidate,
calculate the percentages of votes, and determine a winner.
These results were written to the screen and were also saved
in a text file.  The text file is in the Analysis folder.
